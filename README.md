GREYCORTEX Vulnerability Intelligence Platform

### About
At the moment, this program's purpose is to work with CPE objects - vulnerabilities parsed from the NVD CPE Match Feed file.

It can also parse CVE objects from CVE data feeds (JSON files) at https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds

It can also completely (without content history) parse CWE objects - [XML file](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_latest.xml.zip)

It can also completely (without content history) parse CAPEC objects - [XML file](https://capec.mitre.org/data/xml/capec_latest.xml)

It can also read from file, create objects representing CPE vulnerabilities and insert them into local database.

It also can update CPE vulnerabilities in the database by working with the up-to-date CPE Match Feed file.
