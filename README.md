GREYCORTEX Vulnerability Intelligence Platform

### About
At the moment, this program's purpose is to work with CPE objects - vulnerabilities parsed from the NVD CPE Match Feed file.

It can also parse CVE objects from CVE data feeds (JSON files) at https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds

It can also completely (without content history) parse CWE objects - https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_latest.xml.zip (XML file)

It can also completely (without content history) parse CAPEC objects - https://capec.mitre.org/data/xml/capec_latest.xml (XML file)

It can also read from file, create objects representing CPE vulnerabilities and insert them into local database.

It also can update CPE vulnerabilities in the database by working with the up-to-date CPE Match Feed file.
